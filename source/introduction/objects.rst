An :ref:`object <minio-object>` is any kind of data with no limit to its 
size, format, or type. Examples of objects include digital images, 
text documents, or video files. Applications can store, retrieve, and 
delete objects from a MinIO deployment. 

MinIO objects provide the same core functionality as an Amazon Web Services (AWS)
S3 Object. The MinIO API is fully compatible with the Amazon S3 API, 
where applications can seamlessly transition  to using the MinIO deployment
with minimal code changes.
